In order to prove something by exhaustion, the statement must have a limited amount of cases. You identify these cases, and then prove each one individually to prove the initial statement as a whole.

> [! Example]
> Use proof by exhaustion to show that $(n + 1)^3 > 3^n \quad n \in \mathbb{N}, \; n \leq 4$
> 
> #### Case $n = 1$
> $2^3 = 8, \; 3^1 = 3$, ($8 > 3$)
> 
> #### Case $n = 2$
> $3^3 = 27, \; 3^2 = 9$, ($27 > 9$)
> 
> #### Case $n = 3$
> $4^3 = 64, \; 3^3 = 27$, ($64 > 27$)
> 
> #### Case $n = 4$
> $5^3 = 125, \; 3^4 = 81$, ($125 > 81$)
> 
> All cases of $n$ have been exhausted, therefore the statement is true.
