In order to prove a statement by deduction, you must consider some mathematical concepts which are called 'axioms'. Through these axioms, you use logic and deduce the result.

> [! Example]
> Show that $x^2 - 8x + 17 > 0$ for all real values of $x$.
> 
> $x^2 - 8x + 1(x - 4)^2 + 1 > 0$
> We know that $x^2 > 0 \quad \forall \; x \in \mathbb{R}$, therefore $x^2 - 8x + 17$ must hold the same inequality.
